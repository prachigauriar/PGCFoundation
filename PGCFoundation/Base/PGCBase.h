 @header PGCBase
 @discussion The PGCBase header defines the base types, constants, and polymorphic functions in the PGCFoundation API. 
 
     Of particular importance are the mechanisms for polymorphism that are defined. @link PGCType @/link and the various 
     polymorphic functions are used throughout the API to refer to objects and operate on them in a polymorphic way. For example, 
     @link PGCRetain @/link always invokes the appropriate Retain function for a particular object based on the objectâ€™s class. 
     Thus, calling PGCRetain is almost always preferable to calling a class-specific Retain function implementation, as the code
     will be shorter and more maintainable.

 @abstract The base type for PGCFoundation objects. 
 @discussion PGCType should be used when a function argument or return value can by polymorphic, as it eliminates the need for type

     to simply treat them as PGCObject instances.
